      "\n",
      "Fellow citizens of the United States:  in compliance with a custom as old\n",
      "as the government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly\n",
      "and to take, in your presence, the oath prescribed by the Constitution\n",
      "of the United States, to be taken by the President \"before he enters\n",
      "on the execution of his office.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not consider it necessary, at present, for me to discuss those matters\n",
      "of administration about which there is no special anxiety, or excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States\n",
      "that by the accession of a Republican administration their property\n",
      "and their peace and personal security are to be endangered.\n",
      "There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension.\n",
      "Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while\n",
      "existed and been open to their inspection.  It is found in\n",
      "nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you.\n",
      "I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that\n",
      "\"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with\n",
      "the institution of slavery where it exists.  I believe I have\n",
      "no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\"\n",
      "Those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge\n",
      "that I had made this and many similar declarations, and had\n",
      "never recanted them.  And, more than this, they placed in the\n",
      "platform for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me,\n",
      "the clear and emphatic resolution which I now read:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Resolved:  that the maintenance inviolate\n",
      "of the rights of the States, and especially\n",
      "the right of each State to order and control\n",
      "its own domestic institutions according to\n",
      "its own judgment exclusively, is essential\n",
      "to that balance of power on which the perfection\n",
      "and endurance of our political fabric depend,\n",
      "and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed\n",
      "force of the soil of any State or Territory,\n",
      "no matter under what pretext,\n",
      "as among the gravest of crimes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, I only press upon\n",
      "the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case\n",
      "is susceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no section\n",
      "are to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration.\n",
      "I add, too, that all the protection which, consistently with the\n",
      "Constitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given\n",
      "to all the States when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause--\n",
      "as cheerfully to one section as to another.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives\n",
      "from service or labor.  The clause I now read is as plainly\n",
      "written in the Constitution as any other of its provisions:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No person held to service or labor in one State,\n",
      "under the laws thereof, escaping into another,\n",
      "shall in consequence of any law or regulation\n",
      "therein be discharged from such service or labor,\n",
      "but shall be delivered up on claim of the party\n",
      "to whom such service or labor may be due.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those\n",
      "who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves;\n",
      "and the intention of the lawgiver is the law.  All members\n",
      "of Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution--\n",
      "to this provision as much as to any other.  To the proposition,\n",
      "then, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause\n",
      "\"shall be delivered up\", their oaths are unanimous.  Now, if they\n",
      "would make the effort in good temper, could they not with nearly\n",
      "equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good\n",
      "that unanimous oath?\n",
      "\n",
      "There is some difference of opinion whether this clause should\n",
      "be enforced by national or by State authority; but surely that\n",
      "difference is not a very material one.  If the slave is to be\n",
      "surrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him or to others\n",
      "by which authority it is done.  And should any one in any case be\n",
      "content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial\n",
      "controversy as to HOW it shall be kept?\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of\n",
      "liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced,\n",
      "so that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave?\n",
      "And might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the\n",
      "enforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that\n",
      "\"the citizen of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and\n",
      "immunities of citizens in the several States?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I take the official oath today with no mental reservations,\n",
      "and with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by\n",
      "any hypercritical rules.  And while I do not choose now to specify\n",
      "particular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest\n",
      "that it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations,\n",
      "to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed,\n",
      "than to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity in having\n",
      "them held to be unConstitutional.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President\n",
      "under our national Constitution.  During that period fifteen different\n",
      "and greatly distinguished citizens have, in succession, administered\n",
      "the executive branch of the government.  They have conducted it through\n",
      "many perils, and generally with great success.  Yet, with all this scope\n",
      "of precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief Constitutional\n",
      "term of four years under great and peculiar difficulty.  A disruption of\n",
      "the Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution,\n",
      "the Union of these States is perpetual.  Perpetuity is implied,\n",
      "if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments.\n",
      "It is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision\n",
      "in its organic law for its own termination.  Continue to execute all\n",
      "the express provisions of our National Constitution, and the Union will\n",
      "endure forever--it being impossible to destroy it except by some action\n",
      "not provided for in the instrument itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, if the United States be not a government proper, but an association\n",
      "of States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a contract,\n",
      "be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?\n",
      "One party to a contract may violate it--break it, so to speak;\n",
      "but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Descending from these general principles, we find the proposition\n",
      "that in legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by\n",
      "the history of the Union itself.  The Union is much older than\n",
      "the Constitution.  It was formed, in fact, by the Articles of\n",
      "Association in 1774.  It was matured and continued by the\n",
      "Declaration of Independence in 1776.  It was further matured,\n",
      "and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted\n",
      "and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation\n",
      "in 1778.  And, finally, in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining\n",
      "and establishing the Constitution was \"TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the States\n",
      "be lawfully possible, the Union is LESS perfect than before the Constitution,\n",
      "having lost the vital element of perpetuity.\n",
      "\n",
      "It follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion\n",
      "can lawfully get out of the Union; that Resolves and Ordinances\n",
      "to that effect are legally void; and that acts of violence,\n",
      "within any State or States, against the authority of the United States,\n",
      "are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "I therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws,\n",
      "the Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take care,\n",
      "as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the\n",
      "laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States.\n",
      "Doing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part;\n",
      "and I shall perform it so far as practicable, unless my\n",
      "rightful masters, the American people, shall withhold the\n",
      "requisite means, or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary.\n",
      "I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the\n",
      "declared purpose of the Union that it WILL Constitutionally\n",
      "defend and maintain itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there\n",
      "shall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority.\n",
      "The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess\n",
      "the property and places belonging to the government, and to collect\n",
      "the duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects,\n",
      "there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people\n",
      "anywhere.  Where hostility to the United States, in any interior locality,\n",
      "shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens\n",
      "from holding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force\n",
      "obnoxious strangers among the people for that object.  While the strict\n",
      "legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of\n",
      "these offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating,\n",
      "and so nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it better\n",
      "to forego for the time the uses of such offices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts\n",
      "of the Union.  So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that\n",
      "sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought\n",
      "and reflection.  The course here indicated will be followed unless current\n",
      "events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper,\n",
      "and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised\n",
      "according to circumstances actually existing, and with a view and\n",
      "a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the\n",
      "restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections.\n",
      "\n",
      "That there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy\n",
      "the Union at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will\n",
      "neither affirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word\n",
      "to them.  To those, however, who really love the Union may I not speak?\n",
      "\n",
      "Before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our\n",
      "national fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes,\n",
      "would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it? \n",
      "Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility\n",
      "that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence?\n",
      "Will you, while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all\n",
      "the real ones you fly from--will you risk the commission of so\n",
      "fearful a mistake?\n",
      "\n",
      "All profess to be content in the Union if all Constitutional rights\n",
      "can be maintained.  Is it true, then, that any right, plainly written\n",
      "in the Constitution, has been denied?  I think not.  Happily the human\n",
      "mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this.\n",
      "Think, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provision\n",
      "of the Constitution has ever been denied.  If by the mere force of numbers a\n",
      "majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written Constitutional right,\n",
      "it might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution--certainly would if such\n",
      "a right were a vital one.  But such is not our case.  All the vital rights of\n",
      "minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations\n",
      "and negations, guaranties and prohibitions, in the Constitution, that\n",
      "controversies never arise concerning them.  But no organic law can ever be\n",
      "framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may\n",
      "occur in practical administration.  No foresight can anticipate,\n",
      "nor any document of reasonable length contain, express provisions\n",
      "for all possible questions.  Shall fugitives from labor be surrendered\n",
      "by national or State authority?  The Constitution does not expressly say.\n",
      "May Congress prohibit slavery in the Territories?  The Constitution does not\n",
      "expressly say.  MUST Congress protect slavery in the Territories?\n",
      "The Constitution does not expressly say.\n",
      "\n",
      "From questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies,\n",
      "and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities.  If the minority\n",
      "will not acquiesce, the majority must, or the government must cease.\n",
      "There is no other alternative; for continuing the government is\n",
      "acquiescence on one side or the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce,\n",
      "they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them;\n",
      "for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever\n",
      "a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority. \n",
      "For instance, why may not any portion of a new\n",
      "confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again,\n",
      "precisely as portions of the present Union now claim to secede from it?\n",
      "All who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the\n",
      "exact temper of doing this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there such perfect identity of interests among the States\n",
      "to compose a new Union, as to produce harmony only,\n",
      "and prevent renewed secession?\n",
      "\n",
      "Plainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy.\n",
      "A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations,\n",
      "and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular\n",
      "opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.\n",
      "Whoever rejects it does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism.\n",
      "Unanimity is impossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement,\n",
      "is wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle,\n",
      "anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not forget the position, assumed by some, that Constitutional\n",
      "questions are to be decided by the Supreme Court; nor do I deny\n",
      "that such decisions must be binding, in any case, upon the parties\n",
      "to a suit, as to the object of that suit, while they are also entitled\n",
      "to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other\n",
      "departments of the government.  And while it is obviously possible that\n",
      "such decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect\n",
      "following it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance that\n",
      "it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases,\n",
      "can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice. \n",
      "At the same time, the candid citizen must confess that if the policy\n",
      "of the government, upon vital questions affecting the whole people,\n",
      "is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court,\n",
      "the instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between parties\n",
      "in personal actions, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers,\n",
      "having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands\n",
      "of that eminent tribunal.  Nor is there in this view any assault upon\n",
      "the court or the judges.  It is a duty from which they may not shrink\n",
      "to decide cases properly brought before them, and it is no fault of\n",
      "theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "One section of our country believes slavery is RIGHT, and ought\n",
      "to be extended, while the other believes it is WRONG, and ought\n",
      "not to be extended.  This is the only substantial dispute. \n",
      "The fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution, and the law for the\n",
      "suppression of the foreign slave-trade, are each as well enforced,\n",
      "perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral\n",
      "sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself.\n",
      "The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation\n",
      "in both cases, and a few break over in each.  This, I think,\n",
      "cannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases\n",
      "AFTER the separation of the sections than BEFORE.  The foreign\n",
      "slave-trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived,\n",
      "without restriction, in one section, while fugitive slaves,\n",
      "now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered\n",
      "at all by the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Physically speaking, we cannot separate.  We cannot remove our\n",
      "respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall\n",
      "between them.  A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out of\n",
      "the presence and beyond the reach of each other; but the different\n",
      "parts of our country cannot do this.  They cannot but remain\n",
      "face to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile,\n",
      "must continue between them.  Is it possible, then, to make\n",
      "that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after\n",
      "separation than before?  Can aliens make treaties easier than\n",
      "friends can make laws?  Can treaties be more faithfully enforced\n",
      "between aliens than laws can among friends?  Suppose you go to war,\n",
      "you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides,\n",
      "an no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions\n",
      "as to terms of intercourse are again upon you.\n",

      "This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it.\n",
      "Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise\n",
      "their CONSTITUTIONAL right of amending it, or their REVOLUTIONARY right\n",
      "to dismember or overthrow it.  I cannot be ignorant of the fact\n",
      "that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the\n",

and, in doing so, I only press uponthe public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the caseis susceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no sectionare to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration.', 'I add, too, that all the protection which, consistently with theConstitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully givento all the States when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause--as cheerfully to one section as to another.', 'There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitivesfrom service or labor.', 'The clause I now read is as plainlywritten in the Constitution as any other of its provisions:\"No person held to service or labor in one State,under the laws thereof, escaping into another,shall in consequence of any law or regulationtherein be discharged from such service or labor,but shall be delivered up on claim of the partyto whom such service or labor may be due.\"', 'It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by thosewho made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves;and the intention of the lawgiver is the law.', 'All membersof Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution--to this provision as much as to any other.', 'To the proposition,then, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause\"shall be delivered up\", their oaths are unanimous.', 'Now, if theywould make the effort in good temper, could they not with nearlyequal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep goodthat unanimous oath?', 'There is some difference of opinion whether this clause shouldbe enforced by national or by State authority; but surely thatdifference is not a very material one.', 'If the slave is to besurrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him or to othersby which authority it is done.', 'And should any one in any case becontent that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantialcontroversy as to HOW it shall be kept?', 'Again, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards ofliberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced,so that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave?', 'And might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for theenforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that\"the citizen of each State shall be entitled to all privileges andimmunities of citizens in the several States?\"', 'I take the official oath today with no mental reservations,and with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws byany hypercritical rules.', 'And while I do not choose now to specifyparticular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggestthat it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations,to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed,than to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity in havingthem held to be unConstitutional.', 'It is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a Presidentunder our national Constitution.', 'During that period fifteen differentand greatly distinguished citizens have, in succession, administeredthe executive branch of the government.', 'They have conducted it throughmany perils, and generally with great success.', 'Yet, with all this scopeof precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief Constitutionalterm of four years under great and peculiar difficulty.', 'A disruption ofthe Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted.', 'I hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution,the Union of these States is perpetual.', 'Perpetuity is implied,if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments.', 'It is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provisionin its organic law for its own termination.', 'Continue to execute allthe express provisions of our National Constitution, and the Union willendure forever--it being impossible to destroy it except by some actionnot provided for in the instrument itself.', 'Again, if the United States be not a government proper, but an associationof States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a contract,be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?', 'One party to a contract may violate it--break it, so to speak;but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it?', 'Descending from these general principles, we find the propositionthat in legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed bythe history of the Union itself.', 'The Union is much older thanthe Constitution.', 'It was formed, in fact, by the Articles ofAssociation in 1774.', 'It was matured and continued by theDeclaration of Independence in 1776.', 'It was further matured,and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plightedand engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederationin 1778.', 'And, finally, in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordainingand establishing the Constitution was \"TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION.\"', 'But if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the Statesbe lawfully possible, the Union is LESS perfect than before the Constitution,having lost the vital element of perpetuity.', 'It follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motioncan lawfully get out of the Union; that Resolves and Ordinancesto that effect are legally void; and that acts of violence,within any State or States, against the authority of the United States,are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances.', 'I therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws,the Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take care,as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that thelaws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States.', 'Doing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part;and I shall perform it so far as practicable, unless myrightful masters, the American people, shall withhold therequisite means, or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary.', 'I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as thedeclared purpose of the Union that it WILL Constitutionallydefend and maintain itself.', 'In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and thereshall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority.', 'The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possessthe property and places belonging to the government, and to collectthe duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects,there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the peopleanywhere.', 'Where hostility to the United States, in any interior locality,shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizensfrom holding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to forceobnoxious strangers among the people for that object.', 'While the strictlegal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise ofthese offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating,and so nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it betterto forego for the time the uses of such offices.', 'The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all partsof the Union.', 'So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have thatsense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thoughtand reflection.', 'The course here indicated will be followed unless currentevents and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper,and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercisedaccording to circumstances actually existing, and with a view anda hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and therestoration of fraternal sympathies and affections.', 'That there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroythe Union at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I willneither affirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no wordto them.', 'To those, however, who really love the Union may I not speak?', 'Before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of ournational fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes,would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it?', 'Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibilitythat any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence?', 'Will you, while the certain ills you fly to are greater than allthe real ones you fly from--will you risk the commission of sofearful a mistake?', 'All profess to be content in the Union if all Constitutional rightscan be maintained.', 'Is it true, then, that any right, plainly writtenin the Constitution, has been denied?', 'I think not.', 'Happily the humanmind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this.', 'Think, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provisionof the Constitution has ever been denied.', 'If by the mere force of numbers amajority should deprive a minority of any clearly written Constitutional right,it might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution--certainly would if sucha right were a vital one.', 'But such is not our case.', 'All the vital rights ofminorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmationsand negations, guaranties and prohibitions, in the Constitution, thatcontroversies never arise concerning them.', 'But no organic law can ever beframed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which mayoccur in practical administration.', 'No foresight can anticipate,nor any document of reasonable length contain, express provisionsfor all possible questions.', 'Shall fugitives from labor be surrenderedby national or State authority?', 'The Constitution does not expressly say.', 'May Congress prohibit slavery in the Territories?', 'The Constitution does notexpressly say.', 'MUST Congress protect slavery in the Territories?', 'The Constitution does not expressly say.', 'From questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies,and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities.', 'If the minoritywill not acquiesce, the majority must, or the government must cease.', 'There is no other alternative; for continuing the government isacquiescence on one side or the other.', 'If a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce,they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them;for a minority of their own will secede from them whenevera majority refuses to be controlled by such minority.', 'For instance, why may not any portion of a newconfederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again,precisely as portions of the present Union now claim to secede from it?', 'All who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to theexact temper of doing this.', 'Is there such perfect identity of interests among the Statesto compose a new Union, as to produce harmony only,and prevent renewed secession?', 'Plainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy.', 'A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations,and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popularopinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.', 'Whoever rejects it does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism.', 'Unanimity is impossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement,is wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle,anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left.', 'I do not forget the position, assumed by some, that Constitutionalquestions are to be decided by the Supreme Court; nor do I denythat such decisions must be binding, in any case, upon the partiesto a suit, as to the object of that suit, while they are also entitledto very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all otherdepartments of the government.', 'And while it is obviously possible thatsuch decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effectfollowing it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance thatit may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases,can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice.', 'At the same time, the candid citizen must confess that if the policyof the government, upon vital questions affecting the whole people,is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court,the instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between partiesin personal actions, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers,having to that extent practically resigned their government into the handsof that eminent tribunal.', 'Nor is there in this view any assault uponthe court or the judges.', 'It is a duty from which they may not shrinkto decide cases properly brought before them, and it is no fault oftheirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes.', 'One section of our country believes slavery is RIGHT, and oughtto be extended, while the other believes it is WRONG, and oughtnot to be extended.', 'This is the only substantial dispute.', 'The fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution, and the law for thesuppression of the foreign slave-trade, are each as well enforced,perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moralsense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself.', 'The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligationin both cases, and a few break over in each.', 'This, I think,cannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both casesAFTER the separation of the sections than BEFORE.', 'The foreignslave-trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived,without restriction, in one section, while fugitive slaves,now only partially surrendered, would not be surrenderedat all by the other.', 'Physically speaking, we cannot separate.', 'We cannot remove ourrespective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wallbetween them.', 'A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out ofthe presence and beyond the reach of each other; but the differentparts of our country cannot do this.', 'They cannot but remainface to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile,must continue between them.', 'Is it possible, then, to makethat intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory afterseparation than before?', 'Can aliens make treaties easier thanfriends can make laws?', 'Can treaties be more faithfully enforcedbetween aliens than laws can among friends?', 'Suppose you go to war,you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides,an no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questionsas to terms of intercourse are again upon you.', 'This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it.', 'Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercisetheir CONSTITUTIONAL right of amending it, or their REVOLUTIONARY rightto dismember or overthrow it.', 'I cannot be ignorant of the factthat many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having thenational Constitution amended.', 'While I make no recommendation ofamendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority of the peopleover the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the modes prescribedin the instrument itself; and I should, under existing circumstances,favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the peopleto act upon it.', 'I will venture to add that to me the convention modeseems preferable, in that it allows amendments to originate withthe people themselves, instead of only permitting them to take orreject propositions originated by others not especially chosenfor the purpose, and which might not be precisely such as they wouldwish to either accept or refuse.', 'I understand a proposed amendmentto the Constitution--which amendment, however, I have not seen--haspassed Congress, to the effect that the Federal Government shallnever interfere with the domestic institutions of the States,including that of persons held to service.', 'To avoid misconstructionof what I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particularamendments so far as to say that, holding such a provision to now beimplied Constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made expressand irrevocable.', 'The chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people,and they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for theseparation of the states.', 'The people themselves can do thisalso if they choose; but the executive, as such, has nothing todo with it.', 'His duty is to administer the present government,as it came to his hands, and to transmit it, unimpaired by him,to his successor.', 'Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justiceof the people?', 'Is there any better or equal hope in the world?', 'In our present differences is either party without faith of beingin the right?', 'If the Almighty Ruler of Nations, with his eternaltruth and justice, be on your side of the North, or on yoursof the South, that truth and that justice will surely prevail,by the judgment of this great tribunal, the American people.', 'By the frame of the government under which we live, this same peoplehave wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief;and have, with equal wisdom, provided for the return of that littleto their own hands at very short intervals.', 'While the people retaintheir virtue and vigilance, no administration, by any extreme ofwickedness or folly, can very seriously injure the governmentin the short space of four years.', 'My countrymen, one and all, think calmly and WELL upon thiswhole subject.', 'Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time.', 'If there be an object to HURRY any of you in hot haste to a stepwhich you would never take DELIBERATELY, that object will befrustrated by taking time; but no good object can be frustratedby it.', 'Such of you as are now dissatisfied, still have theold Constitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point,the laws of your own framing under it; while the new administrationwill have no immediate power, if it would, to change either.', 'If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold theright side in the dispute, there still is no single good reasonfor precipitate action.', 'Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity,and a firm reliance on him who has never yet forsaken this favored land,are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty.', 'In YOUR hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in MINE,is the momentous issue of civil war.', 'The government will not assail YOU.', 'You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors.', 'YOU have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government, while _I_shall have the most solemn one to \"preserve, protect, and defend it.\"', 'I am loathe to close.', 'We are not enemies, but friends.', 'We must notbe enemies.', 'Though passion may have strained, it must not breakour bonds of affection.', 'The mystic chords of memory, stretching fromevery battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstoneall over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Unionwhen again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.']\n"
